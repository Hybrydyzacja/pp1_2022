Removing Save Data
------------------
Save data can be manually removed by deleting the following directory:
<My Documents>\BioWare\Mass Effect 3\Save


Optimizing Gameplay
-------------------
Mass Effect 3 will attempt to read the system specifications of the
computer at game startup and automatically choose graphic options
appropriate for the hardware. These settings are chosen based on the
device ID of your video card.

To customize graphics settings to your own values, do so via the options
GUI or the configuration utility. 

The following settings have the greatest impact on frame rate:

Resolution - This significantly affects performance and has the 
greatest influence on how smoothly the game runs. The lower the 
resolution, the better the performance.

Window Mode - If this option is on, the performance can be reduced,
especially if other applications are running as well. We highly
recommend that all other applications be shut down when playing Mass
Effect 3.

Dynamic Shadows - This significantly affects performance on machines
between the minimum and recommended system specifications. Turning
this off will increase performance.

Anisotropic Filtering Level - This moderately affects performance on
machines between the minimum and recommended system specifications.
Turning this off will increase performance.

Motion Blur - Turning this off will increase performance slightly on
machines near our minimum specifications.


Importing a Mass Effect 2 Career
--------------------------------
To import a Mass Effect 2 save file from an old computer to the one in
which Mass Effect 3 is currently installed, copy your old career
folders to: <My Documents>\BioWare\Mass Effect 2\Save\

To copy your Mass Effect 3 save files to another computer, copy your
current career(s) to: <My Documents>\BioWare\Mass Effect 3\Save\

The career files on your old computer will be stored in the same
locations.


Known Issues
------------
Mass Effect 3 does not run optimally on a computer with a single-core
CPU. We recommend that you do not play Mass Effect on a system with a 
single-core CPU.

On some video cards (NVidia 7000 series), Mass Effect 3 may display
bright white spots on some parts of the floor or walls. This issue can
be resolved by turning off the "Texture filtering - Anisotropic sample
optimization" setting in the NVidia Control Panel.

There is a known issue that can cause graphical artifacts when running
an NVidia 7950 GT video card on Windows XP. To reduce the potential for
this issue, please select the "Let the 3D application decide" choice from
the NVIDIA Control Panel in the "3D Settings/Adjust image settings with
preview" section.

Computers with AMD Dual Core CPUs may experience instability if the AMD 
Dual Core Optimizer software is not installed.  The AMD Dual Core Optimizer 
software can be obtained for free from the AMD website.


Online Ports
------------
To enable online functionality, the following ports must be opened on
the client PC.

TCP 42100 
TCP Port Range 15200-15300
TCP Port Range 9945-9994
TCP 80
